        "1. **TextBlob Module:** Linguistic researchers have labeled the sentiment of words based on their domain expertise. Sentiment of words can vary based on where it is in a sentence. The TextBlob module allows us to take advantage of these labels.\n",
        "2. **Sentiment Labels:** Each word in a corpus is labeled in terms of polarity and subjectivity (there are more labels as well, but we're going to ignore them for now). A corpus' sentiment is the average of these.\n",
        "   * **Polarity**: How positive or negative a word is. -1 is very negative. +1 is very positive.\n",
        "   * **Subjectivity**: How subjective, or opinionated a word is. 0 is fact. +1 is very much an opinion.\n",

like when   get older   kinda like   start to recognize parts of  r life as pieces of bigger patterns   know when   re  nger everything s like in   moment but when   re older   s like okay this is part of this larger arc like all my relationships basically go   same way  y re different but  y all kinda follow   same trajectory   know   s   same pattern i get into something   s superintense   as soon as i feel like   slightest b  vulnerable or exposed i get insecure   i project   onto   o r person find something wrong w h  m use   as   reason why i have to stop seeing  m yeah      second time   see someone do   move in toge r  no   second time we go to couples  rapy   s   pattern every single time every single time   so i m like okay so   issue is me  i need to figure my sh  out so i gotta go to  rapy or something   so i went to a  rapist told him my whole life story really opened up to him he said   was some comm ment thing i m like oh   put a lotta thought into   one   fucking idiot

here i try to think about like why   is like what made me   way i think   biggest reason is i have a hearing loss   i ve had since i was really  ng when i was threeyearsold my i failed   hearing test   my doctor was like   need hearing aids    i said no    he said oh okay  he just like let me do   i m three why am i makin this choice someone make   for me like ah well   re an adult   made  r decision i m like what i can t hear now  i don t know what   fuck people are saying i didn t wear  m until i was twentyone  mos two thirds of my life was just guessing  i didn t know what people were saying  people would say sh    look at me i m like ah fuck what i don t know yes what ends this like get me out of this moment please   s a fucking nightmare cause   can t just ask people to repeat

park even if   was  r kid in   pool once   got   kid outta   pool   dried him off   put him in   car on   ride home   d be like   s a pretty good b  like i think   would recognize   level of comm ment alone is impressive like oh my god he brought a gun to a water park  he wa ed in line up   steps for like twenty minutes  he had goggles on why   fuck did he have goggles on who cares if   get water

s like   know i think about   i don t wanna hurt anybody but suicide s a tough one   s a tough one because people get offended at suicide jokes but   s never suicidal people   s always like suicideadjacent people like suicidal people love suicide jokes right   know why cause   s  ir thing like everybody has a thing like if   re married maybe   like a joke about marriage cause   hear     re like oh honey   s so us or whatever suicidal person hears a suicide joke   s   same thing   s like i m not gonna tell anyone but   is so me   re gonna find out in a note how good   joke really was    n regret not laughing more later because   is on   money   s cathartic like if   re dealing w h those private painful personal dark thoughts to hear  m talked about   made light of in a public forum   s a ca hat s catharsis   feel connected to someone outside  r own mind   s a pos ive emotion i m not gonna take   away from someone just to spare someone else a moment of discomfort but i get why people get upset i had a dude once he was like   s not funny    should never joke about    my nephew killed himself   think   s funny i was like what no i was like what no  no   s not what i m talking about at all    s not funny    s incredibly sad  i m sad right now hearing about     know cause  r nephew  would ve loved   joke   s like yeah my target market is missing tragic also if he would ve heard this joke he wouldn t have felt alone as he obviously did     s really my point is if   don t like something just let   go   h    people     s meant for   s not for everybody  re are people who are gonna hate    re s people right now who are like dude i fucking hate this joke     s gone on way too long   i just want   to end     s like all right   now   know how suicidal people feel about

was like our kids i did   research saw     was cheaper than a divorce so we went to hawaii   hawaii is such a special place   really is   s like  re s   aloha spir  where people greet each o r w h aloha but i m so awkward so  y ll be like aloha   i ll be like hello ha does   mean something   means even when i would use   hawaiian terms properly   would backfire like if i said mahalo   natives

let s keep   in  ir wheelhouse  cause i don t tan i don t kind of tan  re s no medium rare for me i ei r look like i ve never been outside or i was just released from a burn un   re s no inbetween   i know people go to   beach to relax people find   beach very relaxing not so much for me   s like being allergic to bees    n for vacation becoming a beekeeper my one goal was to just not burn i didn t want to be   sunburned adult   see a kid w h a sunburn   re like parenting is hard   see an adult w h a sunburn   re like   s an alcoholic right cause a sunburn on an adult is like a scarlet letter for poor judgment  re is no excuse well i was caught offguard this time  i didn t know   fireball in   sky would be hot this time when we weren t at   beach we did activ ies i went ziplining for   last time what is wrong w h us hey   wanna feel like   re about to die  would   pay dollars to feel like   re about to die six times why don t   just walk into traffic did   see   bus almost h  me i feel so alive why don t   just take off  r mask at a biker rally   know if   ve been ziplining   know to slow down   have to spread out  r arms   legs   supposedly slows   down   also makes   look like a suicide oh if he didn t wanna die why was he doing   chalk outline   s such a weird how did  y even come up w h ziplining hey   know how telephone poles have a wire between em  what if we just put   tourists up  re  why would tourists do    don t know why would  y pay to swim w h sharks we did go snorkeling i wasn t worried for myself cause i figured sharks would look at my legs   be like those can t be real  i m not gonna b e into ano r mannequin   s for sure sometimes when my family would go to   beach i d go for a hike by myself which was boring but i figured how to make   fun i started bringing a ketchup packet   halfway through   hike i d open up   ketchup packet   rub   on my h s   my face  n i d just approach romantic couples have   seen my wife  no  but   heard her sassing off to me right  i can still smell her sin  jim   joke s scary    s a scary joke   p emic continues but we re we re also processing part of   p emic we went a year   a half w h no weddings no kids birthday parties no family reunions but   wasn t all good news right right huh some things i don t think some things are coming back like parades i think   might be a wrap on parades  re was never anything   impressive about a parade   re all like hey kids look people are walking  creating unnecessary traffic before   p emic if   ran into a parade   were never like oh cool a parade   were always kind of like i hate humans   only people really enjoying   parade were   people marching in   parade even   people on   sidewalk were like how long is this of course   highlight of most parades is   marching b  right   on tv   bird seye view of   marching b  is so impressive right but on a street level   always felt like   were being invaded by nerds uhoh here  y come hide  r xbox but marching b s are amazing right  y practice as much as   athletes  y re always rehearsing   s amazing how much effort goes into creating something   no one really likes i m kidding i know  re s some marching b  people here        n for those   know like   real y is a marching b  can take a song   s pretty impressive any song   ruin     know like wow i didn t know i could hate uptown funk   much   re never listening to a song   think i wish  re was a marching b  version of this   i underst   re s some proud marching b  people here   in full disclosure i could never be in a marching b  cause i ve had sex he s he s gonna get beat up by a marching b  no i know   people cherish  ir time in   marching b   y do but to me   just seems like we re dissuading careers in music   s like oh   wanna be a musician okay  put on this captain crunch costume  at halftime march around   field while we grab some hot dogs  do   for a couple semesters  n we ll see if   still wanna be a musician did   know   i didn t know this marching b s started as mil ary b s  y would march armies into battle    y were for morale   to intimidate   enemy i don t know how   would work oh no  y know fleetwood mac  should we go back  what if lindsey buckingham is w h  m how did  y convince someone playing a trumpet to march into battle  head on in  re  won t  y have weapons    re gonna fight  m w h music  if   survive please wake us up in   morning w h a  i love   when trumpet players have   plunger at   end who came up w h     know i was listening to   play   trumpet     reminded me of when i clogged my toilet  i d eaten six big macs on a dare anyway  uh i brought my plunger   s kind of clean  if   could place   at   end of  r expensive music equipment   give me a wahwah  go ahead  have   ever thought of becoming a plumber   s ridiculous people always know someone who looks like me wherever i go once a week someone will come up to me   go hey i know someone   looks like   i never know what to say well tell him hi  encourage  m to wear sunscreen   this person who looks like',\n",
              "  ' me never doing something impressive w h  ir life yeah he mows our lawn  we don t even pay him he just does     sounds like my gene pool occasionally on social media i ll be sent photos of babies who supposedly look like me this baby looks like jim gaffigan people think   s hysterical   i look like a pale pudgy bald infant who poops in a diaper sometimes people get too cute  y re like hey why does our baby son look like jim gaffigan i m like  cause i slept w h  r wife now if   think   s humiliating to be told   look like a baby   should know i ve also been sent photos of cats   supposedly  look like me not once or twice we re talking about dozens of different cats always   same message this cat looks like jim gaffigan i don t know what  y re implying   know   i fa red a cat out of wedlock when i was lonely after a show so i went for a walk   an alley cat asked for a cigarette   i said i don t smoke   well we started talking   before   know     sun was coming up i never saw   cat again i can still smell her d er now if   think   s humiliating to be told   look like a baby or a cat   should know i was once sent a photo of someone s kneecap  w h   message this kneecap looks like jim gaffigan –     know what – i did look like   kneecap but i don t know what  y were implying   know   i fa red a kneecap out of wedlock   i was lonely after a show   i went for a walk   a kneecap asked for a cigarette     i said i don t smoke   we started talking before   know     sun was coming up i never saw   kneecap again now if   think   s humiliating  to be told   look like   fleshy wrinkly part of a stranger s leg   is or uh   know i thought   was    n i had this realization i figured out what had happened   know   all made sense  re might be one person in here   s like jim   re crazy but i think   rest of   will see   logic here what happened is this kneecap person obviously went to a plastic surgeon right   said i would like my kneecap to look like   most underrated comedian in america right     plastic surgeon said   mean john mulaney     kneecap person said no jim gaffigan     plastic surgeon said i don t know who   is    n   kneecap person said he s kind of a pale pudgy guy who looks like a baby or a cat   s probably what happened   s weird i normally get told i look like o r humans though i uh in utah i always get told i look mormon i didn t even know   could look like a religion but apparently i do   i ve done research i don t look like one of   founders of   mormons i don t look like a present leader of   mormons i don t even look like a guy who could have more than one wife i just somehow look mormon of course   mormons no longer practice polygamy but for a while  re a mormon man could have more than one wife i don t know if   was a selling point cause i love my wife   i can honestly say i don t want ano r one i feel like disappointing one person is enough could   imagine having two spouses mad at       couldn t drink coffee no thanks i hope   doesn t sound like i m picking on mormons most organized religions have negative stereotypes luckily i m catholic so i don t have to worry about   all right sometimes people don t believe me like are   really catholic  no i m just saying   to impress    i wanna come across like i have good judgment at this point   s almost like catholics are trying to lose followers  y re like what else can we do what else  why don t we make bill cosby pope let s try   catholics have made an art of shrinking  ir religion even back to   great schism of where   eastern orthodox     roman catholics spl  apart   orthodox were like we wanna celebrate christmas in january     catholics were like we like pedophiles i know   one s hard for me too    n  re was   uh protestant reformation   didn t even know this is a religion history class did   no  re was   protestant reformation in   when martin lu r who probably thought he d be   most famous martin lu r right he was like   s   i m   king of martin lu rs  don t be surprised if one day i get my own holiday no martin lu r he had those problems but a b ch ain t one right cause at   time   catholic church was super corrupt thankfully   s not anymore some catholics get really angry   re so cr ical of catholic church why   even catholic because i believe human beings are inherently flawed   s one of   reasons but mainly i m afraid of my wife huh i don t think  re s anything intrinsically wrong w h organized religion   s just   human interpretation right most organized religions god s saying a similar thing he s like i want   to love one ano r     humans are like got   got   he said kill gay people so  let s get to work as a result all organized religions are struggling right now muslims  y re killing   muslims are like oh catholics   think   can alienate people  hold my hummus  let me show   how   s done i m sure some of   are looking at me like hey jim   look like a former h ler  th  what are  r views on judaism  i d like to see   destroy  r career tonight well i m not frightened i ll tell   what i think i think judaism is perfect  re s nothing wrong w h     i d like to be in more feature films   s   s some uh   s some good oldfashioned p ering antisem ism really   only organized religion w hout a negative stereotype is buddhism right   d think more americans would be buddhists cause if   look at buddha he kind of looks like an american buddha looks like someone   d watch   game w h buddha always gets a keg for   playoffs  buddha buddha   know in real life buddha was thin he wasn t even a big guy  y made him heavy to make   religion more appealing cause at   time being heavy was a sign of success also at   time being lighterskinned was a sign of success so back  n i would have been like jeff bezos so bezos who s  r favor e billionairepretend astronaut hmm can   believe  re s a choice     s not between just two we live in a day when billionaires are building  ir own rockets to fly to outer space   no one s saying are   sure  y re paying all  ir taxes  cause i know some teachers   need supplies   s like  se billionaires are trying to execute   plan of a fiveyearold boy when i grow up i m gonna be a bazillionaire    i m gonna build my own spaceship    fly to outer space  okay jeffrey  but now   s time for bed i almost feel sorry for   accountants of   billionaires cause  y were like   had an amazing year    made billion dollars  but i fudged   numbers so   looks like   broke even  as long as   lay low   don t draw attention we should be fine    got anything coming up  i built a rocket   to fly to outer space    know i meant to lay low on this planet  does   matter if   rocket s shaped like a penis i do enjoy   reasoning of   billionaires for going to space  y re like i m going to outer space so eventually   can go to outer space  i m going so   can go  i don t wanna go to outer space  i wanna go to  aly why don t   work on   i saw a h chhiker recently   never see   anymore of

              "  'ke i m gonna kill       h chhiker was like i m gonna kill     i bet  y had a laugh i bet  y laughed    n slowly but surely  y fell in love      s what my musical s about   s called h

was but if he ever came out he could be like i gave   so many hints  i l erally vacationed w h men  we rented out a culdesac  we played w h sticks   balls all day  how clear did i have to make   i guess   point i m trying to make is golf makes people gay so so   next time a friend says i m going to play golf w h   fellas just be like enjoy no i prefer mixed company i do   know  re s a cliché   men are dumb   i have enough male friends to know   s based on some truth every man in here has   friend    y occasionally look at   wonder how  y hold down a job   if   don t think   about a friend   means   re   friend yeah my friend like   is ricky he s a great guy ricky   i one time we went axethrowing don t know if   ve done   throw an axe   drink a beer   try   forget our democracy is in crisis   at one point ricky turned to me   he goes hey before axethrowing what did  y use axe',\n",
              "  's for  uh  chopping wood he s like really   i was like don t talk anymore   like a good friend i ran home turned   into a st up b    i kind of forgot about    n like a month later ricky called me out of   blue   goes i did   i did    i built my own axethrowing range in my backyard yeah he s divorced    n he immediately starts bragging he s like yeah now i could throw an axe yards   h  a bullseye i m like   s impressive    know when   s gonna come in h y never he ll be like hey   never know i m like no i do know even if someone broke in  r house     happen to be holding an axe   re not gonna be able to say hey can   come feet closer i like having women around for many reasons not least of which is  y re attractive   men are not   know like when a guy s goodlooking   s like a fluke of nature     know what all attractive men have in common  y kind of look like women right   s   only way straight guys can tell who s goodlooking wow he must be attractive he barely looks like a dude women are attractive   compared to men  y re very clean men are gross   make very l tle effort to not be gross like if aliens vis ed earth  y ll be so confused  y ll be like   attractive feminine gender is taking an hour to get ready   those hairy beasts are just ready  no wonder this planet s always at war men are gross   as  y get older grosser when women get older  y become more elegant as men get older  y look like  y re decomposing   ever seen an old guy w h   shirt off he looks like   first draft of a human what is   a simpsons character because when men get older things stop working   synapses stop connecting normally brain s like every month i m gonna grow hair on this guy s head every month i m gonna grow hair on this guy s head but one month   brain s like every month i m gonna grow hair everywhere but this guy s head i have hair growing in parts of my body i don t need do   wanna know why older men grow hair on weird parts of  ir body   s nature s way of saying   re done  stop mating or i m going to turn   into a throw rug i have some body hair not as bad as some men which is a relief cause as   can see i did not win   genetic lottery i am bald blind   pale   wouldn t surprise me if i woke up tomorrow w h a tail have   seen   comic w h   tail  he s very pale     tail even has a bald spot i saw a guy this summer at   pool he s probably had his shirt off not a lot of body hair all body hair for a second i thought  y were shooting a geico commercial this guy was he was so hairy i had to stop my  ngest son from trying to pet him let him smell  r h  first son this guy was hairy   he was walking around   pool w h   confidence like he d spent a lifetime dealing w h hairy s uations no one said anything but everyone had   same thought please don t go in   pool  no one s prepared to see   shake dry   this man walked right by everyone   he sat down next to an attractive woman   i was so impressed   woman could look beyond this man s appearance   focus solely on his wallet whoo but we all wanna be goodlooking right we all wanna be chased on   playground right some people go so far as to get plastic surgery  y re like oh i don t wanna sound desperate but can   take a knife to my face    make me pretty just keep cutting   s kind of amazing more of us don t get plastic surgery because we live in a beautyobsessed society right  re are studies  re was a harvard study   found   children believed goodlooking people are nicer   study also found   children are stupid we defin ely give goodlooking people   benef  of   doubt like if a really attractive person s quiet we think  y re mysterious if a fat person is quiet we assume  y re thinking about food   we are we are but  re s still a mystery   don t know what kind of food all right   s cake   s always cake but   don t know what kind all right   s red velvet as a result we just like being around beautiful people   ever been out to eat     have a wa er or wa ress   s really attractive for a second   re like wow this is gonna be a good meal   ever have an ugly wa er   re like should we leave i think   s why buffets started   know what i ll get my own food thank    i don t need   mug near my entrée   know what i mean  jim   re a monster we follow goodlooking people on social media instagram beautiful people have millions of followers   we like  ir photos   sometimes we put a flame emoji   s totally socially acceptable if   did   in real life   d go to jail excuse me sir what are   doing  i m following   lady  uh can i ask why  i like to look at her  can   give her this torch i brought her     se prayer h s everyone s got to settle down w h   prayer h s emoji   overuse is ridiculous got a text from a friend see   at dinner prayer h s  no no prayer h s

getting a divorce   not surprisingly my wife was very upset w h me i wasn t surprised cause this wasn t   first time something i had nothing to do w h was my fault trump s election   kavanaugh hearings   was my fault   i apologize cause i unconsciously planned   whole thing now i would never describe my wife as crazy cause i like to be married but i do think   s interesting   if a man calls

reverse cowgirl but i m on top are   picturing     s good   s really good nobody gets pregnant   s a lot of fun i m trying to learn things about myself um i got a scale for my bathroom i m not trying to lose weight i m just interested in   data   i did learn something i learned this because i weigh myself every night before i go to bed    n i also weigh myself on   morning when i get up   i here s what i learned i weigh two pounds less every morning than when i went to bed   i found out why   s because i sh  in my bed every night i do i take a full twopound dump in bed    n i turn out   lights   i go to sleep because i don t want to sleep alone  r needs change when   get older at my age a big big pile of sh  s as good as anybody i actually have a girlfriend but we re struggling because she lives in france uh she s french she lives all   way over  re   we haven t been able to see each o r for a year because of   disease i have aids   uh  she s great though she sends me presents all   time   s how she keeps   going she sends me gifts in   mail i get something from her every week sometimes   s chocolate from france or a shirt she wishes i would wear instead of things like this   sometimes she sends something to make fun of me because she s a l tle fucked up so last time she sent me a pair of l tle girl s panties   uh yeah i was like   s not funny because  se are in my house now i can t get rid of em   s like nuclear waste think of   i can t throw  m out because i can t have people find l tle girl s panties in my garbage w h coffee grounds   butter on em   every solution i think of makes   worse like if i if i put em in a bag inside ano r bag   layers of duct tape wrapped in tinfoil or if i put him in a coffee can   i nail   shut   i bury   in   park in   middle of

just right on   l tle strawberries here s   thing men our biggest fear in life is   we re going to get caught being a kid fcker   s every guy s biggest fear even if   would never do   every guy s like   s what s going to happen to me i know     s like being afraid of sharks when   live in   desert like i don t go to   ocean but   s going to happen  cause   s a fear not based in  s likelihood but in how horrible   would be if   happened because when  y catch a pedophile holy fuck holy sh    s brutal because we re scared we re so scared of pedophilia because   s here     s not going anywhere   s a fact   s not like  re s a fin e amount of pedophiles   we got   last one no  y keep   keeps happening every generation  re s more some of   have kids   some of  m are going to grow up   fck kids  y might   know okay no i m of course of course not  rs for some reason but   y re coming from some place so any real solution has to start w h   basic real y    re will always be pedophiles not a great thought i underst    s not an uplifting   wouldn t put   on a fridge magnet or on  r screensaver at   office  re will always be pedophiles  hey where s jim he s not at his desk we do we have to start w h   real y because our solutions   we have so far don t really work here is our current solution to pedophilia we wa  till somebody fucks about kids    n we go all right     better cut   out   s pretty much    re is no measures for preventing   none we have no policy to prevent   pe no we re not even just like a street sign  re s a street sign for everything no hunting  no sp ting  no skateboarding i ve never seen a don t fck a child sign in   w i ve been all over   world not even just like a picture of a guy fcking a kid w h a line through   so     transcends language barriers i mean try     won t get most of  m w h   sign but even if one out of of  m is like oh sh  i m sorry i didn t know   was an issue   s money well spent  re s things   might work   we don t even try  m like is anybody working on very realistic child sex dolls okay  n let em fck  r kids forever is th if   s better i m so sorry for suggesting something   might actually work oh no let em fck both my

just a sh load of kids being fucked in   boy scouts i think   s mostly    y find out     guy wants to i don t actually know though i don t do   know why i don t know because i m afraid to look   up i ll go to prison for typing   into a google how do   solve a problem if   re afraid to fucking look   up how many boy scouts get fucked on a   oh sh   every time i move i ve got to tell my neighbors   i looked   up here s what happens every few years   find out  re s some pedophiletype people in   boy scouts    n  y announce we got we got em all we re good    n a year later whoa  re s a bunch more  what s going on here at some point   ve got to wake up to   basic fact     maybe   people who are best su ed to give  r kids  se wonderful experiences are folks   want to fck  m maybe   s maybe   s

pretty amazing to be alive during this thing during covid because   re not going to see this again   wow did we learn some sh    s really   things   teach   in life are things   never would have chosen to do for  rself i mean think about  r life as far as   s been where   had   choices where   re like i m going to do this i m going to pursue this   all goes to sh  every b  of     even when   goes right   re like why don t i like     s what i wanted but why don t i like   because   s  r choice    r choices are based on fear   fucking just thin stupid sh ty hopes but when life just kicks   in   balls     re like oh fuck everything s different now       shows   sh    wouldn t have looked at o rwise   s   great joy in     what i thought was really interesting about covid   still is is     s   first thing i ve seen where everyone on earth had   same problem every human being on earth had   same problem   we never had   before   s why we don t give a sh  about each o r because   read

              "  'me i think about   maybe adopting   know i could adopt a baby from a third world country   s a good thing to do because   can just leave em outside   don t have to    know   s interesting we ve been adopting babies from o r countries in america for a long time   know o r countries do   too but i live here so i ll talk about   but   s an interesting thing   s not a biological imperative to go get a baby from thous s of miles away but we ve been doing   in large numbers here for a long time   not always for   same reasons  re s been different reasons why we ve done   in   early like in    when i grew up sometimes   d meet a couple who had an african baby    y brought because  re are those kind of   know  se kinds of people   know   kind of couples   hold h s when  y announce things   know those kind of people  y ga r  ir friends    y re like we ve decided    know those  y have a farm table w h a clay pot of honey on      ir apple juice is cloudy   know what i m talking about those are   kind of people   make a trip to zimbabwe   get a baby   name him kevin   send him to boston college whatever   was like        n in      became very popular w h gay couples started to adopt babies from china because  y want to have a baby but  y can t  y both have dicks i don t know if   know   did   know   gay couples have two dicks so  y can t make a baby   can try   can this is really fuckin    could    could try to cum into one dick w h   o r like if   line up to dick holes     could cum     sperm goes up this dick   down   one    n this sperm gets to   balls   he    y re like what   fuck where  did we turn around cause we re in   balls again whose balls are  se  se aren t even his balls oh he s gay fuck all right okay all right well just swim around until we re dead   s just   way   is   re not going to a baby will never come out of a penis which is good   s a good thing because   s hard for women imagine pushing a whole baby out of  r penis dickhole even just   h  yeah anyway so   s why gay couples adopt   s why   often from china because  y make a lot of stuff  re uh  so   was     was   gay couples were adopting chinese babies because  y couldn t have babies    n    n a lot of o r couples started doing   more around   turn of   century i used to live in hollywood which is a pretty awful place   everybody  re gets chinese babies   s very popular  y go because     s not because  y can t have babies     s not because  y re trying to help somebody from far away   s because  y re just busy  y re busy  y want to have a baby but  y don t want to have a baby   know what i mean   thing where   can t have  r baby   eat   too or what i don t know how  y want to get pregnant is   point so  y go to china  y don t even go to china  y go to   airport   somebody from china meets  m gives  m a baby   s true  y just take   home    n  y get a jamaican nanny to watch  ir chinese baby    y go to cocktail parties we have this chinese baby   s amazing   meanwhile   chinese baby     jamaican nanny are just alone looking at each o r like what are we doing what is what is this why can t ei r of us see our families why  what   fuck is   point of this so yeah my dog i got a dog my kids are eh   i just s  around   watch uh watch  tube a lot   s my favor e pastime um i was watching  tube today i was watching one of   ads   comes on before

in my life please don t smoke cigarettes cigarettes are very very bad for   first thought i had was why does he still have an accent   s coming out feels like if   bypass   mouth   shouldn t have an accident anymore does   machine have a setting for puerto rican is   just how air sounds coming out of this guy does he fart w h an accent  senor i m farting anyway after   ad i watched   video   i

banana on sixth avenue     bo red me i ll tell   why because   s   way he when i peel a banana i hold around here i peel down to my h  right this guy holds   banana at   bottom   he just peels   whole thing all   way down   felt like a guy at a urinal pulling his pants all   way to his ankles i was like dude tmi w h   banana right now what are   making a smoothie on sixth avenue what are   doing   banana was like hey   don t even know how much   re going to eat i have a bruise right here kind of got lost in   banana shame  re   wanna hear   o r banana one now all right okay so i was at   grocery store   i needed bananas so i go over to where   bananas are    re s a black woman at   bananas   s going to be okay   s going to be okay i swear i underst  wh e people are very scared of discussing bananas   black people in   same conversation i underst  if i have a black friend over i would never offer him a banana i just i don t know why i just wouldn t do   hey   want a banana  why   fuck   asking me  hey man sorry   have an apple i m really sorry  se are just   facts of   case all right i was in a store looking for bananas    re s a black woman in   bananas   i wanted to i didn t want to go  re while she s  re because of covid we re all giving each o r space so i i but i do want to be next so i m wa ing   she s kind of takin a long time     longer she takes   longer i m a wh e man watching a black woman choose bananas   this is an awful thing about   world today because i know i m not doing anything wrong but i feel fucking bad i feel fucking bad so i went to   strawberries    re s a fckin jew at   strawberries  here s a nice one    s   jew i m not going to do   black woman no not   know why because i m not afraid of jews   s really   s   bottom line i m not scared of jews i don t find jews to be frightening unless   re in palestine  n  y re terrifying   s very different over  re  y re like   jews are killing us   here we re like really   jews  we ve been slapping  m around for years anyway this banana s too hard  well this banana s soft but i m not gon have   till tuesday so i m gonna buy   hard one   wa  just trying to be fair just trying to be fair to   jews lawd have mercy anyway  don t worry i m an old man i ll be gone very soon i worry about getting old only cause i don t want to lose my memory   know i mean some of   i would love to lose but   doesn t work   way   got to take   all or none i guess but i lose i forget things   know like remember fonzie from happy days i don t remember him i don t even know what   re talking about i forget weird things   know like i was walking down   street once in new york    re was a guy in a van   he roll down   window   he said hey get in   van   suck my dck   i said all right   know so i got in   van     know i was trying to pull   door   sliding door but   kept   he s like   just shuts don t   don t have to i was like sorry he s like everybody does     s okay so i m kneeling on   floor of   van on like a purse    re s no lady in  re but i m like i came here to suck this guy s dck not like take inventory i should just get to work so i started suckin his dck   about halfway through i m guessing i remembered   i don t really like doing   so senior moment some people worry about getting old because  y think   means    y re dying which   does but this doesn t worry me i don t worry about dying because i think   s necessary i think   s something     just have to do   should do     s when   s  r turn   should do   if somebody   know  r doctor says   re dying just say okay   die don t   know may be a miracle fuck   get in   ground just take  r turn i really think   way now i didn t used to but i do because i   know when i started thinking   way was when my mom died my mom died a couple of years ago of anorexia she was pounds she was bad at   i know   s fucked up right hmm what a piece of sh  anyway she would have liked   joke she would have my mom fuckin she was gross   i remember when she was dying i was i was alone w h her     nurse said this is this is imminent i was like what does   mean she goes   s she s going to die in a minute i m like just say in a minute   s so close anyway i was alone w h her   she died   i was like fuck  y re going to think i did   obviously i didn t want to lose my mom i really didn t but i but we had this one conversation like two weeks before she died when we were we were talking about     i said mom i don t want   to die   she said   ll get over     s what she said   i did but in   moment i wasn t willing to accept   i was like i don t want   to go she said but we re going in order do   underst  this makes sense i m  r mo r i m like mom stop talking like   this is sad she goes no   s not look at   this way would do   want me to never die i was like no i don t want   at all     helped me get in touch w h an important idea which is   dying is important   s every generation s greatest contribution to history is    y die   s   only thing   keeps things moving   s   only reason  re s any progress in   human race is   folks keep fucking dying every generation has had a mix of douche bags   amazing people   boring great good whatever but  y re all fucking dead every fuckin one thank god  y re all fucking dead  re s a lim  to how much any of   good ones did     sh ty ones got to stop being sh ty   s a great system now when   look at   internet   all  se people   re like what   fuck is happening  y    s okay  y re all going every th all of  m are going to die i mean   don t want to die   don t want to die   don t want  r loved ones to die but   s a selfish wish when   think about what would happen if nobody died what kind of world would this be if  re was no nobody d if we still had people here from     s hard enough having people here from ',\n",

              "  'ntry  re s like a congressional gridlock right everyone always threatening a government shutdown government shutdown yo  re s no government shutdown w h asian people in charge we don t shut down for anything yo we don t shut down for christmas do   underst  we work through public holidays any c y in america when   s am     re hungry where do   go   go to chinatown   s where   go because things are affordable delicious   open does   sound like a country   want to live in we don t shut down for anything thanksgiving means nothing to me do   have any idea how meaningless   concept of thanksgiving is to me fuck turkey   s dry yeah i d ra r fix healthcare than eat turkey how about   is   someone   want to charge please vote for   asians when   get a chance we ll work while   re eating   we got   votes asian people we got   votes man i m telling   everyone  y want us we just need to corral   everybody loves us jewish people will vote for us because like i just said we re   only ones   cook for  m during christmas okay  y re already loving   flavors  alians   greek people will vote for us because we have a shared culture of familybased food activ ies also we beat our children we know what   takes to make good people black people black people will vote for us because we re not wh e right  i m not saying   s automatic okay i m just saying all things equal  y re gonna go w h   not wh e but   s   tiebreaker   s what i m trying to say okay don t take   for granted   still gotta work for   black vote but if   get   overtime   have   advantage right uh     s    latinos   indian people will vote for us yeah because we pfft i don t know we have rice in our cuisine okay i don t know i don t have all   answers i m just saying  re s something  re also we beat our children really really really   beating of   children is   thing   un es most of   races into   fist   beats   children   think of how inspirational   would be if we have   first asian president what an inspirational message   would send to asian children everywhere in america if we have   first asian president   could go up to asian children anywhere in america   can finally say hey listen buddy   don t have to be just a neurosurgeon      sky is sky s   lim   re is no bamboo ceiling if   shut up   work even harder   fucking piece of sh     gotta get behind   message   s such a weird stereotype to have associated w h  r ethnic y right   stereotype of asian parents wanting  ir kids to be doctors right   s such a weird thing to have on  r race like what is   is   good is   bad i thought   was a good thing apparently   s worthy of mockery right asian parents wanting  ir kids to be doctors   s weird because   s true right i know because my parents were   same way  y just wanted us to be doctors   was like this obsession  y just wanted us to be doctors     s insidious as well because when asian parents want  ir kids to be doctors helping people is like on   bottom of   list of reasons oh if   even makes   list of reasons to go into medicine helping people is like   unfortunate byproduct  of becoming a healthcare professional like when  y first see    y can t even believe    y re like what   fuck   gotta help people well whatever get   out of   way but don t let   get in   way of what this is really about   s about   money     prestige right   s   money     prestige because if   re a firstgeneration immigrant  r children becoming doctors is   quickest way   can turn   around in one generation instant credibil y instant respectabil y instant money right   flip   clan narrative around boom started from   bottom now we here we re doctors      s also weird because asian parents are also   last group of people   can ever convince to see a doctor yo  se fucking people will never see a doctor  y spend  ir whole lives obsessing over   nothing can make my mom see a doctor  re s nothing my mom can have an arrow going right through her   she s trying to pull   out like rambo right     re like yo mom let s go see a doctor   my mom will be like no  y just want to take people s money   n   re like  n why do   want  r kids to be doctors so badly  because i want my kids to take o r people s money obviously    fact     don t underst    is   reason why   never became a doctor  because chinese people love money we love   sh  chinese people fucking love money okay   think rappers love money yo we love money  more than anyone chinese people love everything about   we love making   love spending   we love giving   we love receiving   we love throwing   up in   air yo chinese people love money so much we have a god of money of all   gods in chinese taoism  re s one god he s   god of money caishenye we pray to him for more money every day we go hey god of money   give us more money   he gives us more money very fickle god doesn t care about inflation right no underst ing of basic principles of macroeconomics just just throwing out gold ingots if   ask for   at   right time here s some money burn some incense here s some money man even during chinese new year   biggest holiday for chinese people chinese new year when we see each o r during chinese new year   way we greet each o r is we say gong xi fa cai or gong hei fat choy in cantonese i m sure   ve heard   at least peripherally gong xi fa cai gong xi fa cai means hope   get rich    s not happy new year

i m on   train packed all   way to   doors     doors start closing in front of me   as   doors start closing this guy like walks up to   closing train doors   just jams his fingers  just right into   door no regard for his limbs or appendages like his need to get on this train exceeded his need to grip things he did a costbenef  analysis in his head   he was like   know what this is overrated right who needs this motion who needs this point of articulation right let s get on this train my life will be perfect so he just creates enough of a gap to start fighting   he fights this train for eight seconds he just fights   to a stalemate okay   s a judges decision he can t move   train   train can t move no one can move   after eight seconds he gets like tired he starts gassing out so he uses his head to jam up   doors like a doorstop as he readjusts his grip right he starts to chalk up his h s for round two   i m st ing  re just facing   top of his oily scalp  just thinking yo man just let   go all right i m new in town i m not sure if i m supposed to help   or if we re both going to get arrested okay i don t know   social etiquette in this s uation  all i know is  re s a train in three minutes  this is   ace line in manhattan all right if   let this go we will all get to where we need to go to quicker but he s like no this is   one man this is   last train ever   he fought   train for like four more seconds   he won he won   train tapped out right   was like all right gotta respect  r ground game full mount to omoplata is out of control anyone else wanna run in at   last

 starts going after  r family right   start   start like bleeding out on   tracks   doors open we all walk over  r dead corpse  yeah   s what   get   dumb fuck  not in america in america one man can stop   entire train line because everyone can make a difference yeah yeah   s been great living in america yeah new york c y   s a great c y but by any objective measure   s like   s just barbaric right if   compare   to o r c ies like if   go to japan any c y in japan– anyone here been to japan by any chance yeah japan japan s like awesome right   s like   future if   go to japan everyone s so pol e   friendly very courteous very conscientious society in general right practical application of advanced technology in japan  y have toilets in japan   can wash  r asshole did   know   i bring news from   orient in japan  y have toilets   can wash  r asshole clean    y ve had this now for decades this isn t best of  on buzzfeed okay this was mastered   implemented in    everyone has one   s by default  y have   right restaurants homes hotels everyone has one     works i was skeptical too first time i saw one i was like  re s no way this thing works   s a fucking gimmick oh how wrong i was hot jet stream of water on target every time how is   on target every time   never has an off day   s like steph curry from   free throw line just automatic on target every time how how how   s like every toilet in japan has a camera   a guy aiming   in   back he s   same guy who carries  r luggage up to  r hotel room     people in   west don t really know this but chinese people   japanese people have like beef stretching from world war ii because in world war ii japan did tons of war atroc ies to chinese people rape torture human experimentation   whole nine yards china all   way down sou ast asia thail  malaysia singapore philippines vietnam indonesia   people in   west don t really know this because  re s no schindler s list for chinese people okay no one made a dope black   wh e

experience as much joy as   do than when   re trying to organize three wedding simultaneously in fact   only way   can experience more joy is if   organize those three weddings as far away from  r physical location as possible because   ll find     enjoymentversusdistance graph increases exponentially   fur r away   weddings are from  r physical body so fun   cheap so   first wedding in
